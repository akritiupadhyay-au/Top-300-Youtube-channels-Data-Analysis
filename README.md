# Top 300 Youtube channels: Data Analysis

I recently worked with a captivating dataset sourced from Kaggle. My analysis delved into a range of intriguing inquiries, including but not limited to correlations between various data points, identification of the most viewed and subscribed channels, and compilation of comprehensive lists of channels categorized by genre.

Additionally, I endeavored to pinpoint the least and highest ranked channels in each genre, while also determined the names of the most viewed channels within each genre. I relished the opportunity to experiment with some built-in functions in seaborn and pandas, augmenting my skillset along the way.
